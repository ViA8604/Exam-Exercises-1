# Final Programming Exams: 1st Year CS ðŸ’»

## Practice Repo with Recursion and Trees Solutions ðŸŒ²

The first year of Computer Science can be a tough challenge! ðŸ¤¯ My good colleague, "The Bald" (don't mind the nickname, XD), and I collaborated to solve some of the older Matcom exams. We even gave the recent ones a good try, though some were a bit too much for us. (Don't worry, we **mastered** them! ðŸ¤ )

**What's in it for you?ðŸ‘¾**

This repo includes the exam instructions (in Spanish) and our solutions. The code is in English, so you might find this useful if you're battling the final boss of Recursion and Trees exams. ðŸ’ª

**Let's tackle those exams!** ðŸš€

We hope this repo helps you on your journey. Good luck, and may the force be with you! âœ¨
